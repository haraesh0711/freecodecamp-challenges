  <p align = "justify" class = "infocolor">The first book I remember ever reading was Enid Blyton's <i>The Folk of the Faraway Tree</i>. Set in a seemingly normal land by the woods, three children show one of their acquaintances the wonders of a gigantic, ever-growing tree whose tips reach out beyond the skies. It was there that I started reading books, at the top of the Faraway Tree, amused by all the weird names and personalities. My love for books grew from there, and when people call me a bookworm in the present, my thoughts go back to this English writer.</p>
<center><h2 class = "headingcolor">History</h2></center>
<p align = "Justify" class = "infocolor">Enid Blyton was born in South London to Thomas Carey Blyton and his wife, Theresa Mary. The eldest of three children, Blyton had two brothers, Hanly and Carey. She loved her father very much, and inherited his love for nature, arts, music, literature and the theater; however, she was not close with her mother, who showed little to no interest in her daughter's pursuits. Her father left her when she was 13, however, and she was devastated.</p>
<p align = "Justify" class = "infocolor">Blyton attended St. Christopher's School in Beckham from 1907 to 1915, where she was the school's tennis champion, lacrosse captain and head girl. Her talent for writing showed itself here, and after she finished her education, she trained to be a teacher, eventually becoming one in Bickley Park School. She moved to Southernhay in Hook Road Surbiton as nursery governess to the four sons of Horace Thompson, and owing to the shortage of schools in the area, a small school developed in their house with her taking care of the children.</p>
<center><h2 class = "headingcolor">Writing Career</h2></center>
<p align = "Justify" class = "infocolor">Blyton moved to Chessington in 1980 and began writing in her spare time. Her first book, <i>Child Whispers</i>, was a collection of poems, and it was after that she started writing for a local publication, Teachers' World. Her educational texts became popular, and in the 1930s she started taking an interest in ancient mythology. Her rise to success started with her creation of <i>The Talking Teapot and Other Tales</i>, and eventually made way to <i>The Enchanted Wood</i>, the Brer Rabbit series and all the other novels she penned. She became in charge of editing <i>Sunny Stories</i>, a children's magazine, and was given a column of her own in <i>Teachers' World</i>, events that shaped and cemented her reputation as a children's writer.</p>
<p align = "Justify" class = "infocolor">Blyton has written 762 books encompassing various genres, including the <i>Faraway Tree</i>, <i>Famous Five</i>, <i>Secret Seven</i>, <i>Malory Towers</i> and <i>St.Clare's</i> series.</p>
<center><h2 class = "headingcolor">Personal Life</h2></center>
<p align = "justify" class = "infocolor">Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, the editor of the book department in George Newnes, a publishing firm, in the August of 1924, and had two daughters, Gillian and Imogen. Her relationship with Pollock became quite troubled, however, and after her divorce with him, she married Darrell Waters, a London surgeon.</p>
<p align = "justify" class = "infocolor">Her health began to deteriorate in 1957 when she started displaying signs of dementia. She eventually started losing her mind to what is now known as Alzheimer's Disease, and died on 1968 in a nursing home in Hampstead, North London. Two of her book series, <i>Malory Towers</i> and <i>St.Clare's</i> were continued on by Pamela Cox.</p><br>
